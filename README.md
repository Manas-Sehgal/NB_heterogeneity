# Random Swap analysis 
To generate histograms for PC1 variance for random comnbinations of NOR/MES genelists and Housekeeping genes, use the PC1_Variance_Histogram.r script 
Add pre-processed gene-expression matrix files as tab-delimited .txt files in the datasets folder.

For Boxplots with random swaps with Housekeeping genes (one at a time) use the PC1_Swap.r script

# Linear Fit to PC1 Means
Add mean values of PC1 variance for each swap to a GSEID.csv file in the PC1_Means folder and use the Linear_fit.py script
